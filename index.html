        <h2>Erislandy Lara</h2>
        
          <p class="quote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erislandy_Lara">Erislandy Lara</a> Santoya (born April 11, 1983) is a Cuban-American professional boxer. He has held the WBA light middleweight title since 2014 (promoted to Super champion in 2016) and the IBO light middleweight title since 2015. As of May 2017, he is ranked as the world's best light middleweight by The Ring magazine, second by BoxRec, and fifth by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board.

            <strong>Lara</strong> is widely regarded as one of the most technically skilled fighters in boxing today.[1] He was captain of the Cuban national amateur team, winning a gold medal in the welterweight division at the 2005 World Championships as well as three consecutive Cuban national championships from 2005 to 2007.</p>
            
            <p><em>Erislandy Lara</em> was considered a favorite to win the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. However, in 2007, Lara and Guillermo Rigondeaux defected from Cuba during the Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Some weeks later, he was caught by Brazilian authorities and returned to Cuba where he was banned from practicing boxing indefinitely.

            In 2008, Lara attempted a second defection, this time on a speed boat to Mexico. Lara was successful and made his way to Hamburg, Germany, where he joined former Olympic champions Odlanier Solis, Yan Barthelemy, and Yuriorkis Gamboa in the Arena Box-Promotion stable.</p>

            <h2>Luis Ortiz </h2>
            
            <p class="quote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Ortiz_(Cuban_boxer)">Luis Ortiz</a> (born March 29, 1979) is a Cuban professional boxer. He held the WBA interim heavyweight title from 2015 to 2016; he originally won it 2014, but this first reign was nullified via no contest when he was stripped of the title due to failing a drug test.[1] Ortiz was again stripped of the title in 2016. As an amateur, Ortiz won a silver medal at the 2005 Boxing World Cup. Nicknamed "The Real King Kong", he is known for his size, punching power and counterpunching skills. Ortiz's credibility has been called into question after failing multiple drug tests; testing positive for anabolic steroids in 2014 and also for diuretics in 2017.</p>
            
            <p>A 30 year old Ortiz made his debut on February 16, 2010 against American boxer Lamar Davis (4-1, 1 KO) in a scheduled 4 round bout at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Ortiz won the fight via TKO after just under 80 seconds of round 1. Ortiz fought again at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for his 2nd professional fight on June 15 against 39 year old Charles Davis. Ortiz won via TKO in round 4. In his 3rd pro fight, Ortiz claimed the vacant WBC FECARBOX heavyweight title against 28 year old Kendrick Releford (22-13-2, (10 KOs) on August 24, 2010. Releford was knocked down once in round 2, as Ortiz won the fight via 8 round unanimous decision (80-72, 79-72, 79-72). Ortiz won his next 2 bouts via 8 round stoppage against Zack Page and Francisco Álvarez (12-1, 10 KO) improving his record to 5 wins in as many fights, with 4 coming within the distance. Ortiz fought at the Double Tree Westshore Hotel in Tampa, Florida on January 28, 2011 against Rubén Rivera (3-5, 1 KO). Rivera was deducted 2 points in round 4 and then disqualified in round 5 for repeated low blows.</p>
